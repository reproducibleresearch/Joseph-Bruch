# BST Individual project. 

I attempt to replicate several of the figures/tables on the NYT map and daily case count for January 18, 2021. I found very similar results to the NYT. There were a couple of areas where my results differed from the NYT website. I was unsure whether to include January 18 cases in the dataset or whether to include Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Marina Islands. I decided to include them but I believe it resulted in some minor differences. The one major place where my results differed was the 14-day change. They show a 3% increase in cases but the  7-day average curve (used to calculate 14-day change) was higher on Janu 4 than Jan 17, so I am not sure how they calculated these results. Here is how to navigate my repository:

1. 270_individual_project.Rmd provides the r code and output for said code. 

2. I provide the us_counties.csv I read the documents from url so it is not necessary. 

3. I provide a pdf of the code and output using knitr.
