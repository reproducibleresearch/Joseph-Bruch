In May 2020, the Georgia Department of Public Health posted the following plot to illustrate the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in their hardest-hit counties over a two-week period. Health officials claimed that the plot provided evidence that COVID-19 cases were decreasing and made the argument for reopening the state.

The plot was heavily criticized by the statistical community and several media outlets for its deceptive portrayal of COVID-19 trends in Georgia. Whether the end result was due to malicious intent or simply poor judgment, it is incredibly irresponsible to publish data visualizations that obscure and distort the truth. 

Data visualization is an incredibly powerful tool that can affect health policy decisions. Ensuring they are easy to interpret, and more importantly, showcase accurate insights from data is paramount for scientific transparency and the health of individuals. For this assignment you are tasked with reproducing COVID-19 visualizations and tables published by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
Specifically, you will attempt to reproduce the following for January 17th, 2021:

1. New cases as a function of time with a rolling average plot - the first plot on the page (you don't need to recreate the colors or theme)
2. Table of cases, hospitalizations and deaths - the first table on the page
3. The county-level map for previous week ('Hot spots') - the second plot on the page (only the 'Hot Spots' plot)
4. Table of cases by state - the second table on the page (do not need to include per 100,000 or per capita columns)

Data for cases and deaths can be downloaded from this [NYT GitHub repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) (use `us-counties.csv`). Data for hospitalizations can be downloaded from [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data). The project must be submitted in the form of a Jupyter notebook or RMarkdown file and corresponding compiled/knitted PDF, with commented code and text interspersed, including a **brief critique of the reproducibility of each plot and table**. All project documents must be uploaded to a GitHub repository each student will create within the [reproducible data science organization](https://github.com/reproducibleresearch). The repository must also include a README file describing the contents of the repository and how to reproduce all results. You should keep in mind the file and folder structure we covered in class and make the reproducible process as automated as possible.

```

Critique: I was able to replicate the NYT results. I did attempt to try the color scheme that they created but was unsuccesful. Additionally, I found it difficult to discern whether we should include January 18th, 2021 on onward. I decided to include these days after going back and forth. Additionally, I did not know whether to include Marina Islands, Puerto Rico, and Guam. I kept them in but couldn't figure it out on the NYT website.

Critique: Most of the values are the same.I was unable to get a rounding average with + for the cases total reported, but I got a similar value unrounded. Unfortunately, I was not sure whether to include several of the locations (Puerto Rico, Guam,and Marina Islands), so I think some of the values were slightly different. My January 17th numbers (col 2) confirm to the NYT's. However, the 14-day average is different. I don't see how they see positive increases since the graph shows that Jan 18th rolling average is lower than the 4th. 

3. The county-level map for previous week ('Hot spots') - the second plot on the page (only the 'Hot Spots' plot)

            mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,
                          fill = cases, 
                          group = group))

p1 <- p + geom_polygon(color = "gray90", size = 0.05) + coord_equal()

p2<-p1 + labs(fill = "Average daily cases per 100,000 people in past week")

p2

```

I was able to replicate the graph in the NYT. However, because the county population data was not supplied, I did not adjust for size as shown in the graph. Even though it was not graded, I found this actually very useful since I have for a while been procrastinating in learning how to make county-level ggplots.

4. Table of cases by state - the second table on the page (do not need to include per 100,000 or per capita columns)

us_states<-aggregate(us_states$cases, by=list(us_states$state), FUN=sum,na.rm=TRUE)

#Now I get daily average

colnames(us_states2) <- c("state","date","cases")

us_states2<-reshape(us_states2, idvar = "state", timevar = "date", direction = "wide")

us_states2$avgchange<-((us_states2$`cases.2021-01-17`-
  us_states2$`cases.2021-01-16`)+
  (us_states2$`cases.2021-01-16`-

colnames(us_states2) <- c("DAILY AVG. IN LAST 7 DAYS","State")
us_states2[,c("State")]<-NULL
etable4<-cbind(us_states,us_states2)
head(etable4)


```

Critique: I got the same results for each of the values and as instructed did not include per capita values. I found this challenging since I was not sure how to use the zoo package to calculate average changes within a state. This was generally, however, doable using my own code and not utilizing a function.
